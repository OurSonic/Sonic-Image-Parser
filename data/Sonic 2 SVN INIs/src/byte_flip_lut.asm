;****************************************************************
;*  The following table serves as a lookup table that is used   *
;*  by tile loading routines to mirror tiles horizontally on    *
;*  the-fly. Each byte represents the mirrored data for each    *
;*  possible byte of tile data. For example, if the byte of     *
;*  tile data was $D6 (1101 0110 in binary), its mirrored value *
;*  would be $6B (0110 1011 in binary).                         *
;*  This array needs to be aligned to a 256 byte boundary in    *
;*  order for the addressing mechanism to work properly.        *
